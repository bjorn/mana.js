# Mana.js

This was a quick prototype whether a game like The Mana World could be
developed to run entirely in the browser. It demonstrated that it could, but
development didn't continue beyond that point.

## How to Run

Install the dependencies and start the server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then, connect to the server using any number of browsers and the players should
see each other walk around.
